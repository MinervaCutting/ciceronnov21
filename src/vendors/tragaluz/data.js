    ` Passatge de la Concepció –a private and quiet passage that connects Passeig de Gràcia and Rambla Catalunya– seems to be the fetish of Grupo Tragaluz, since there are three of fifteen restaurants that prestigious group has in Barcelona.`,
    ` Open since 1989, Tragaluz is its flagship restaurant. Located on the top floor of El Japonés, the restaurant has a complete renovation since 2011 that makes it even more attractive.`,
    ` We have retained two levels and the movable glass roof that allows to enjoy lunches and dinners under the sun or in the moonlight. The first level has a wonderful open kitchen, while the second is also perfect to taste exquisite cocktails.
    `,
    ` Moreover, the restaurant remains true to the formula that has achieved so much success. It is a modern Mediterranean-inspired cuisine made with fresh ingredients and always well presented.
    `,
    `  The restaurant has 3 private areas: Main dinning room (up to 70 pax), Altillo (30 pax) and Chimenea (50 pax):
    But they offer us 2 options: 
 <lu>
 <li> Sala Chimenea up to 50 pax</li>
 <li> From 51 to 150 pax we would need to have the restaurant in exclusive with a minimum expense of 11.000€</li>
 </lu>

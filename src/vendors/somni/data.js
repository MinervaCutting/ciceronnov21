    ` At the styreet level of the The One Hotel, in l'Eixample of Barcelona, the Somni Restaurant with its exclusive Catalan cuisine is located.`,

    ` In its menu we can find the perfect combination between tradition and sophistication thanks to Chef Miguel Mu√±oz. This delicate Mediterranean cuisine with intense flavors and quality ingredients offers us rice, fish and exquisite meats, of which the Tuna Tataki de Almadabra with cream of avocado, pesto and pickled onion, and the suckling pig confit at low temperature, compote de granny smith and liquorice sauce, are authentic representatives.`,

    ` To welcome the delights of Somni the Chilean architect Jaime Beriestain devised an exclusive and sophisticated environment, where Jordanian marbles, textiles and gold details illuminated by well-studied points of light, provide comfort and pleasure.`,

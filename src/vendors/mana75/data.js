    ` In a space with an original and impeccable interior design and an impressive terrace of more than 300 square meters, we can enjoy a Mediterranean set menu prepared with fresh products.`,
    ` In the kitchen of Maná 75, the marine flavor takes on special prominence given its location. While we savor some great starters, in Maná 75 we can see how our paella is prepared in a large bar with 19 stoves, the largest show cooking of rice from Europe.`,
    ` In short, Maná 75 is   a pleasure for the eyes and the palate.`,

    ` The main dinning room has capacity for 150 pax seated. The restaurant also has a big terrace, but as the dinner will be in february, we suggest use only the indoor area `,

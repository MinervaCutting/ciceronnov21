    ` A majestic Catalan Modernist building from the early 20th century, bourgeois icon of the district of Sarrià full of history and beauty, houses since late 2009 the Dos Torres restaurant, a great dining option in uptown Barcelona that keeps the stately charm of past times and welcomes us into a truly exquisite setting.`,
    ` The place is divided into different spaces. On the one hand, on the ground floor is La Jacaranda, a charming gastrobar with a bohemian and chic look where we will enjoy excellent creative small plates. On the other hand, on the top floor is the restaurant itself that, recently renovated by the interior designer Estrella Salietti, welcomes us in a delicious atmosphere and offers chef Carlos Cases’ superb seasonal cuisine.`,
    ` The wonderful garden-terrace, divided into different levels, is a 200-aquare-meter urban oasis that invites us to have breakfast, lunch, an afternoon snack or dinner and even to enjoy a drink at night`,

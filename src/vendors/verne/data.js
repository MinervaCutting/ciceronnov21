    ` Opened in 2015, Verne recreates an original aquatic environment thanks to the inspiration of Captain Nemo and its submarine Nautilus. Giant jellyfish and tentacles hanging from the ceiling are some of the elements that decorate the room and make us feel like we were in the deep ocean.`,
    ` <strong>Verne</strong> is certainly a different and funny venue where we can organize a chill mingle event`,
    ` The menu offers Mediterranean dishes and, how could it be otherwise, recommended seafood tapas ideal for sharing. After dinner, the restaurant remains open to provide good signature cocktails served in seashells in a very original way.`,

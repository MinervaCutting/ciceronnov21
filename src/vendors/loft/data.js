    ` With the opening of a new garden-terrace, turned into an oasis in the centre of Barcelona, Windsor now offers a new experience to its customers.`,
    ` In this space we can enjoy outdoors, the sunlight, the peace offered by the interior patio of a typical building in Barcelona’s Eixample, a more relaxed atmosphere and a new menu -which adds to the usual-in which features tapas, small plates and the best gourmet products are the protagonists. There are also options for vegetarians.`,
    ` Since its foundation, Windsor is peace and quiet, intimacy and discretion and from today it is much more. It is light, freshness and means leisure and relax.`,
    ` <strong>The respect for tradition, with the right touch of modernity is Windsor’s hallmark and makes it a place of reference to understand the evolution of Catalan cuisine.</strong> Here traditional recipes cooked by chef Carlos Alconchel seem different. They're fresher, bolder and lighter, but at the same time they still evoke the taste that we all have engraved in the depths of our memory. These are recipes with a new life, surprising and modern.`,
